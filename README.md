FullMovieMeter
==============
A web application that cross references [r/fullmoviesonyoutube](http://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube) with movie ratings from [Rotten Tomatoes](www.rottentomatoes.com).

Demo it here: http://fullmoviemeter.herokuapp.com

####Technologies:
* Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS
* Reddit API
* Rotten Tomatoes API

####Development:
In development, run a local server, for instance:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Note that you will need to add your own API secrets at development/secrets.js. Alternatively you can plug in development/sampleData.js instead of making API calls.
