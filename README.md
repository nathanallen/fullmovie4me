FullMovie4Me
==============
A mash-up of Reddit and Rotten Tomoatoes so you can find good movies to watch online for free. Originally conceived as a pure client-side app called [fullmoviemeter](https://github.com/nathanallen/fullmoviemeter), and now fleshed out with a backend/api (hosted on Google App Engine) and the minimalist [riot.js](https://muut.com/riotjs/) front end framework.

####Technologies:
* Google App Engine (Python)
* [Riot.js](https://muut.com/riotjs/)
* Reddit API
* Rotten Tomatoes API

####Development:
First install the the Google App Engine SDK.
Note that you will need to add your own API secrets for Reddit / Rotten Tomatoes in app.yaml. See the example file.
